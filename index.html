        <h2>Marshalls</h2>
        <h4>2018(ish)</h4>
        <section>
            <p>When I first turned 16 on my birthday I remember walking into Marshalls to hand my application to a manager. My sister worked there over the years
                before I did and thought it would of been a good idea for that place to be my first job

        <h2>The Home Depot</h2>
        <h4>2020</h4>
        <section>
            <p>Because of covid and everything going on at the time I needed a job that was going to stay open so I could keep getting paid.
                I remember the first time I went out in weeks that wasn't a grocery store was The Home Depot to pick up an item. It was insanely packed
                and for some reason something about all the people being around I wanted to work there... they also paid more so yea.

        <section>
            <p>I am using this as a filler because I've only worked at two places before and I need one more.
